 * Circle conditions from PaleoSketch paper:
 * 1- The stroke must have passed the closed shape test from pre-recognition.
 * 2- The strokeâ€™s NDDE value must be high. This value tends to be less relevant for small ellipses, so this condition is ignored if the major axis does not meet certain length requirements.
 * 3- To verify that a stroke is better fit with a circle rather than an ellipse, we find the major axis to minor axis length ratio, which after subtracted from 1.0, must me less than some value
 * 4- Feature area error verification
